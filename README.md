# gSwag
Like all great ideas gSwag was born from a complaint from students who wanted their hoodies earlier than graduation.
An instructor challenged the students in Galvanize's G42 Web Development Immersive.  He explained to them that they now had the necessary skills
to design a basic CRUD application and a database with all of the cohorts's student information and told them if they wanted them so badly maybe if they build an app for it someone in management just might decide they deserved to get their sweatshirts early. With the very busy schedule these students have this may have been in jest, however, it turns out a few students were very cold.
Current Galvanize Students can search to see if they are in the database on the
right. If the student is not they can fill out their information to be added along with sizing specifications.
If a student is already in the database they can make changes if needed. To view all records
by cohort please click in the top right on 'View Reports'.
